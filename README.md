# E-Commerce Analytics and Customer Segmentation Case Study

## Project Overview
This project analyzes an e-commerce dataset to:
- Identify revenue trends and top-performing product categories.
- Perform customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.
- Provide actionable insights for improving customer retention and profitability.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- Power BI/Tableau (for optional dashboard)
- Jupyter Notebook (for project development)

## Key Insights
1. High-value customers represent 15% of the customer base but contribute 60% of revenue.
2. Electronics and Fashion drive the majority of profits.
3. Customers at risk of churn need re-engagement campaigns.
